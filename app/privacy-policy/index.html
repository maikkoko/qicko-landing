            pages of the Platform and customise them for users; identify visitors on the Platform;
            carry out research on our users’ demographics and behaviour; provide you with
            information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including

          </li>
          <li>
            When you register an account with Qicko or otherwise provide us with your personal
            information through the Platform, we will also use your personal information to send you
            marketing and/or promotional materials about our or third party sellers’ products and
            services from time to time. You can unsubscribe from receiving marketing information at
            any time by using the unsubscribe function within the electronic marketing material. We
            may use your contact information to send newsletters from us and from our related
            companies; and
          </li>
          <li>
            In exceptional circumstances Qicko may be required to disclose personal information,
            such as when there are grounds to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent a
            threat to life or health, or for law enforcement purposes, or for fulfilment of legal and
            regulatory requirements and requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Qicko may share your personal information with third parties and our affiliates for the above
        mentioned purposes, specifically, completing a transaction with you, managing your account
        and our relationship with you, marketing and fulfilling any legal or regulatory requirements and
        requests as deemed necessary by Qicko. In sharing your personal information with them, we
        endeavour to ensure that the third parties and our affiliates keep your personal information
        secure from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, or similar risks and retain your
        personal information only for as long as they need your personal information to achieve the
        above mentioned purposes.
